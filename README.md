# secure-checkout-wordpress-plugin

Secure Checkout Plugin for WordPress: A plugin designed to securely transmit cart details and payment information to an external payment processor, ensuring the confidentiality of delivery addresses, and enabling cart sharing features. It integrates with Stripe for payment processing and offers a REST API endpoint for generating shareable cart links. The plugin is structured with a main controller class that extends the WP_REST_Controller, providing methods for processing payments, validating and sanitizing request parameters, decrypting data, and generating shareable cart links. It's designed to ensure user authentication for sensitive actions and to store shared cart details securely in the database.
